NAME
    Progress::Any::Output::TermProgressBarColor - Output progress to
    terminal as color bar

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
     use Progress::Any::Output;
     Progress::Any::Output->set('TermProgressBarColor', width=>50);

DESCRIPTION
    THIS IS AN EARLY RELEASE, SOME THINGS ARE NOT YET IMPLEMENTED E.G.
    TEMPLATE, STYLES, COLOR THEMES.

    This output displays progress indicators as colored progress bar on
    terminal. It produces output similar to that produced by
    Term::ProgressBar, except that it uses the Progress::Any framework and
    has additional features:

    *   colors and color themes

    *   template and styles

    *   wide character support

    *   displaying message text in addition to bar/percentage number

    XXX option to cleanup when complete or not (like in Term::ProgressBar)
    and should default to 1.

METHODS
  new(%args) => OBJ
    Instantiate. Usually called through
    "Progress::Any::Output->set("TermProgressBarColor", %args)".

    Known arguments:

    *   width => INT

        Width of progress bar. The default is to detect terminal width and
        use the whole width.

    *   color_theme => STR

        Choose color theme. To see what color themes are available, use
        "list_color_themes()".

    *   style => STR

        Choose style. To see what styles are available, use "list_styles()".
        Styles determine the characters used for drawing the bar, alignment,
        etc.

    *   template => STR (default: '%p [%B]%e')

        See fill_template in Progress::Any's documentation. Aside from
        template strings supported by Progress::Any, this output recognizes
        these additional strings: %b to display the progress bar (using the
        rest of the available width), %B to display the progress bar as well
        as the message inside it.

ENVIRONMENT
  COLOR => BOOL
    Can be used to force or disable color.

  COLOR_DEPTH => INT
    Can be used to override color depth detection. See Color::ANSI::Util.

  COLUMNS => INT
    Can be used to override terminal width detection.

TODO
    Background updating (through threads or forked process), so progress can
    still be updated even though the main process is waiting on I/O or
    external process. But we need to think of a good way to synchronize
    output.

    Animations, like rotating line ("- / | \ -") or pulsating (". o O o .").
    Also animation by varying colors.

    Detect connection speed and degrade to lower-frequency updating if
    connection is slow.

    Styles. Preset formats as well as some behaviors like animation.

    Detection of column change. On each update(), retrieve terminal width
    again.
